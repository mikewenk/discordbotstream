# ElizaBot for Discord
 
This repo contains a bot for discord that will implement Weizenbaum's ELIZA program.  The initial try will be for ELIZA to interact with users on a configured channel.  Ultimately I'd like ELIZA to talk.   I'm wondering just how well AWS Rekognition and AWS Polly could be used to process the input and do output.  I have absolutely no idea if that's possible, but why not give it a whirl. 

# Disclaimer: 
This bot should NOT be used for anything that is not entertainment.  We'll leave mental health to the pros.  


# Why ELIZA? 

I discovered ELIZA in the 80s as it was one of the only examples of natural language processing I had seen.  I was pretty young, don't recall the age, but I was younger than 11.  It was literally the first thing I ever saw that even attempted to interact as a person.  

# Why Go? 

Mostly because I want to use this as a way for me to strengthen my go skills.  I've developed in a lot of languages over the years, from BASIC to C to Java with many others in between.  I've used go off and on since late spring last year, and I enjoy it.
